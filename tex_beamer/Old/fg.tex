	\textbf{Gist of the idea:} schemes where cheating costs more than being honest.

	\begin{block}{Theorem}
		Consider a delegation protocol for $f$ where:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the honest prover pays $C^*$;
			\item for any cheating provers investing $\tilde{C} < C^*$ the probability of being found out is \textit{overwhelming} (e.g. $1-2^{-n}$).
		\end{itemize}
		Then this protocol yields a sequentially composable rational proof for $f$.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Proof}
		
		\begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]	
			\item Pay a prover $R^*$ if the protocol accepts and 0 otherwise;
			\item \textit{Any} ``lazy'' cheating worker will obtain a negligible reward;
			\item Therefore the work that worker is saving cannot compensate how much reward it is giving up.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

\begin{frame}{Our Result in Progress}
\begin{block}{}
	\label{res:delegation}
	If $L \not = \NC^1$, there exists a \textit{non-interactive} delegation scheme:
	\begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]	
		\item for computations in $\NC^1$,
		\item secure against adversaries in $\NC^1$,
		\item where the delegator is a constant-depth circuit (w/ unbounded fan-in),
		\item and both the input and output remain private to the delegator.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques}
	 \textbf{Main Idea:} Exploits techniques based on homomorphic encryption for delegation of computation [CKV10]
		\begin{itemize}[<+- | alert@+>]	
			\item We take a PKE scheme secure against $\NC^1$ adversaries and make it (somewhat) homomorphic within $\NC1$
			\item We use relinearization techniques from [BV13] and show they can be used for low-depth circuits;
			\item We observe that the reductions in [CKV10] can be carried out by circuits of low depth.
			\item We use other (standard) techniques for depth reduction of circuits to increase expressivity of the resulting scheme.
		\end{itemize}
